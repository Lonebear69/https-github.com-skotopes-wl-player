About:
==========================================

Wl Player - small audio player with histogram and spectrogram support.
Was developed like a replacement for wordpress player(http://wpaudioplayer.com/)
Can be used instead of it, but have no customization options and other whistles and crackles.

Features:
==========================================

Basic features:
1) it can play audio (cool, isn`t it?)
2) show histogram (it works like mask for background or spectrogram)
3) show spectrogram

Remote control throw the JS-api is available and probably partially compatible with wp-audio player

Usage:
==========================================

It`s better to use JS-wrapper then direct object embedding, 
anyway it`s better to know what are you doing.

First of all we need to setup environ:

<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="audio-player.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
  AudioPlayer.setup('../bin/wlplayer.swf', {
    'transparentpagebg': 'yes',
    'width': 700,
    'height': 100
  });
  </script>
</head>

Second argument is default options.

then you can use instances:

<p id="audioplayer_1">Alternative content</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_1", {
  'soundFile': 'http://share.white-label.ru/previews/3bb390e0-edd7-11de-8fd6-000423b32792',
  'maskFile': 'output.png'
});
</script>

First argument is unique id, second is options.
Full list of options:

Must have:
'soundFile' - file url

Additional:
'maskFile' - histogram mask (FF0000 - mask color + alpha for mixing png24/png8 is good)
'backFile' - spectrogram file (any flash supported format)
'gWidth'   - |
'gHeight'  - |-> hack in case if you cary about ie6/ie7 users (long story with ie cache + onResize)

Known bugs:
==========================================

No width 100% support. Only exact size.
Some webkit-based browsers and opera may skip event handling 
when you got more then 10 instances on one page. By the way it`s not a bug, but flash feature
In case if you need to have lot of player on one page, then soundcloud way is for you.

PS:
==========================================
flash is sucks anyway. It`s slow and buggy, but everyone have it ;-(
Probably the best way for such things now is js+html GUI + 1 flash sound backend

anyway, if you have good ideas let me know in comments
